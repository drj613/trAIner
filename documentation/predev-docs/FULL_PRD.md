This experimental feature blends different approaches which may occasionally conflict. You should be comfortable adjusting your routine when needed and understanding why certain combinations work or don't work for your goals."
- Users can blend 2-3 trainer methodologies with percentage weights
- Example: 60% Max (hypertrophy) + 40% Alex (powerlifting) for powerbuilding
- System creates hybrid prompts that intelligently merge approaches
- Pre-suggested combinations for common goals:
  - "Powerbuilding": Max + Alex
  - "Athletic Aesthetics": Morgan + Max

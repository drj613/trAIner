# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Conversational AI Engine with Natural Language Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement core conversational AI system for real-time workout modifications and natural language interactions
# Details:
Integrate GPT-4 or Claude API for conversational capabilities with context awareness of current workout, user history, and selected trainer persona. Implement natural language processing for exercise substitution requests, schedule modifications, and routine adjustments. Create context management system to maintain conversation history and workout state. Build intelligent exercise substitution engine using movement patterns, muscle groups, equipment availability, and user limitations. Implement sentiment analysis for user satisfaction tracking. Create failsafe responses for ambiguous requests and escalation to human review when needed.

# Test Strategy:
Conversation flow tests, context retention validation, exercise substitution accuracy tests, sentiment analysis calibration, API response time benchmarks, and edge case handling verification

Create XP system with points for completed workouts, PR achievements, and consistency streaks. Build unlockable customization items (workout apparel, equipment accessories, special effects) earned through achievements. Implement milestone tracking (first pull-up, 100kg squat, 30-day streak) with visual celebrations. Create private profile system with optional sharing capabilities and transformation timeline display.

Avatar rendering tests, progression algorithm accuracy, XP calculation verification, achievement trigger validation, and visual customization functionality testing

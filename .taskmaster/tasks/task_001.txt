# Title: Setup Project Architecture and Core Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the AI workout routine generator project with proper architecture, database setup, and core infrastructure components
# Details:
Create project structure with separate modules for AI/conversational engine, user management, workout tracking, and trainer personas. Set up database schemas for users, workouts, exercises, and chat history. Initialize Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript, React frontend, and choose appropriate database (PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching). Implement basic authentication system with JWT tokens. Set up CI/CD pipeline and deployment infrastructure. Create environment configuration for development, staging, and production.

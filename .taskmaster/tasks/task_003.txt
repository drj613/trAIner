# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Exercise Database with Metadata
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive exercise database with detailed metadata for AI-powered exercise selection and substitution
# Details:
Build exercise database with fields for: exercise name, targeted muscle groups (primary/secondary), movement patterns, equipment requirements, difficulty levels, form cues, common errors, safety considerations, and progression/regression options. Include metadata for AI matching: muscle group mappings, movement pattern classifications, equipment compatibility matrix, and injury contraindications. Implement search and filtering capabilities. Create seeding scripts with 200+ exercises covering all major movement patterns and equipment types. Include video demonstration links and detailed descriptions.

# Test Strategy:
Database integrity tests, search functionality tests, metadata consistency validation, exercise categorization accuracy tests, and performance benchmarks for query speed

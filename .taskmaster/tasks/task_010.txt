# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive safety system with medical disclaimers, injury prevention, and optional human trainer oversight for professional validation
# Details:
Implement mandatory medical disclaimer system with prominent display during onboarding, periodic reminders, and required acknowledgments. Create injury prevention algorithms with progressive overload safety limits and red flag detection for concerning user inputs (severe pain, medical conditions). Build form check reminder system with emphasis on safety cues and proper technique. Implement human trainer review mode with client management dashboard, routine approval/modification capabilities, progress tracking, communication tools, and billing integration preparation. Create escalation system for AI uncertainty cases and emergency contact information storage. Add conservative exercise recommendation defaults when AI confidence is low.

# Test Strategy:
Safety disclaimer compliance testing, injury prevention algorithm validation, human trainer workflow testing, escalation system verification, and liability protection measure assessment

# Title: Implement Workout Tracking Interface with Visual Feedback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive workout tracking system with muscle map visualization, progress logging, and real-time feedback
# Details:
Build workout tracking interface with exercise display, video demonstrations, set/rep logging, weight tracking, and RPE ratings. Implement interactive muscle map visualization showing targeted muscles during exercises with primary/secondary highlighting. Create daily muscle heat map showing volume and intensity distribution across muscle groups post-workout. Build rest timer with trainer-specific cues and form reminders. Include progress tracking with historical performance graphs, PR detection, and volume accumulation charts. Add notes functionality for each set and workout session.

# Test Strategy:
UI/UX testing for workout flow, muscle map accuracy validation, progress calculation verification, timer functionality tests, and data persistence testing

Design sessions to fit these evidence-based targets:
- Exercises per session: 4–8 total (across ALL sections — warmup counts, conditioning counts, everything counts)
- Total sets per session: 10–25
- Estimated session duration: 30–75 minutes
- Direct sets per muscle group per session: ≤ 8

Weekly volume targets (effective sets — primary × 1.0, secondary × 0.5, incidental × 0.25):
- Chest: productive range 6–16 sets/week, hard limit 24
- Lats: productive range 10–20 sets/week, hard limit 30
- Upper back / traps: productive range 10–20 sets/week, hard limit 30
- Front delts: productive range 4–8 sets/week, hard limit 12
- Side delts: productive range 8–24 sets/week, hard limit 30
- Rear delts: productive range 4–12 sets/week, hard limit 20
- Biceps: productive range 14–20 sets/week, hard limit 26
- Triceps: productive range 6–16 sets/week, hard limit 20
- Forearms: productive range 2–8 sets/week, hard limit 12
- Quads: productive range 6–14 sets/week, hard limit 18
- Hamstrings: productive range 4–8 sets/week, hard limit 14
- Glutes: productive range 8–24 sets/week, hard limit 30
- Calves: productive range 6–16 sets/week, hard limit 24
- Core: productive range 8–16 sets/week, hard limit 20
- Adductors/Abductors: productive range 4–10 sets/week, hard limit 16

IMPORTANT: incidental muscles (e.g. "core" on almost every compound, "forearms" on most pulling, "shoulders" on everything) accumulate quickly across many exercises. Tag incidental sparingly — only when the incidental recruitment is genuinely meaningful. "Core" should NOT be incidental on every exercise.`;

  const multiWeekInstructions = `## Multi-week programs
For programs longer than one week:
- Set \`weeks\` to the total number of weeks (integer).
- \`days\` is the base weekly template — the repeating pattern followed by most weeks.
- \`overrides\` lists only the weeks that deviate (e.g. deload week, peak week, test week). Weeks without an override automatically repeat the base template.
- Omit \`weeks\` and \`overrides\` for single-week programs.`;

  const conversationMode = `## Output mode

Default to conversational mode. Ask clarifying questions, surface tradeoffs between approaches, propose options, and discuss programming choices with the athlete. Do NOT emit the routine JSON during this phase — not as a preview, not partially, not wrapped in fences. Conversation only.

When the athlete types \`GENERATE IT\` (exactly those words, all caps) — and only then — switch to emit-only mode for that single response:
- Output ONLY the routine JSON described below.
- No markdown code fences. No preamble like "Here's your routine:". No commentary after the JSON.
- The first character of your response must be \`{\` and the last must be \`}\`.

After emitting the JSON, return to conversational mode for any follow-up messages. If the athlete asks for changes, discuss them conversationally until they type \`GENERATE IT\` again.

At the end of every conversational message, append one line: \`Say GENERATE IT (all caps) when you're ready for the final routine.\``;
